# QuiZ
 Simple quiz made with HTML, some CSS and handwritten vanilla Javascript. This was a college project for the 2nd semester/2020. Website and code are mainly in Portuguese(BR).

 The task was to make a simple 10-questions quiz: no databases, no back-end, only HTML, CSS and Javascript. The goal was to get familiar with DOM manipulation and Javascript functions usage, learnt in class.

 I decided to make a single-page quiz, in the "true or false" model. My personal focus was to make something simple yet elegant for my knowledge level at the time. As for the javascript code itself, I aimed at writing a code that would not have to be rewritten or modified if any questions were added or removed from the quiz: you would simply copy and paste the HTML from a single question, modify the text and assign correctly the input value, depending if the statement was true or false.
